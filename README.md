# Java Blockchain

A simple blockchain implementation in Java for educational purposes. This project demonstrates the core concepts of blockchain technology, including blocks, hashing, proof-of-work, and chain validation.

## Features

- Block creation and chaining
- SHA-256 hashing
- Proof-of-work (mining)
- Blockchain validation
- Simple transaction structure

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 8 or higher
- Maven (optional, if using for build)

### Running the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/java_blockchain.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd java_blockchain
   ```
3. Compile and run the main class:
   ```
   javac -d bin src/*.java
   java -cp bin Main
   ```

## Usage

- The main class demonstrates how to create a blockchain, add blocks, and validate the chain.
- You can modify the code to experiment with different block data or proof-of-work difficulty.
